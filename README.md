# backend-Food-App
This is my first rest API, food app api is a restful api designed to store Product data and Transactions. This API already uses JWT Redis authentication and authorization.
This Rest API already uses JWT, redis and Multer to validate the size and file extension. This application is still under development, if there are suggestions and criticism I am very happy to receive it
